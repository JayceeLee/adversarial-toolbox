## Adversarial toolbox

Toolkit for working with adversarial images using PyTorch

### WIP

### Generate images

offers multiple ways to generate adversarial examples for standard neural network architectures

Generate images with common techniques

* Fast Gradient Sign Method - FSGM

* Box Constrained L-BGFS

* DeepFool

* Universal Adversarial Images

* Jacobian Based Saliency Map Approach - JSMA

### Architectures supported

* MLP

* VGG with batchnorm (16 and 19)

* Resnet (all)

* GoogLeNet (all)

* Logistic Classifier

## Deconvolution

Deconv any layer of supported networks to see activations and intermediate representations. 
Or visualize weights of an adversarial network
